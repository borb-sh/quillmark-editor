// surface recovered from — and one field's one problem should read as one thing, so the
// merged set is deduplicated before it reaches the editor that routes it.
//
// Routing is by `path`, the document's own address space: a diagnostic carrying one
// reaches the control it is about. A diagnostic carrying `location` instead names a file,
// a line and a column in the quill's source, which routes to no control and is read off
// the compile-failure strip. One carrying neither reaches nothing.
