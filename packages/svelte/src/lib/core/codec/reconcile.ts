// Reconciliation: the field-scoped external-change gate (CODEC §Reconciliation).
// The content normalizes on write, so `decode ∘ lower` is idempotent only up to
// normalization: the optimistic PM state and the re-decoded stored content agree
// after normalize, not byte-for-byte. So the field holds its PM state and
// re-hydrates only on an external content change (another edit source, a paste, a
// `revise`), gated by canonical-content equality scoped to the leaf's addr: the
// analog of web-app's whole-document `Document.equals`, narrowed to one field.
// Caret continuity across the field's own edits is the PM `StepMap`, not this.
//
// One seam, two questions, four verbs. "Is this the same value" is `contentEqual` and
// `valueEqual`, here; "what does this value group as" is `kindKey` (`encode.ts`) and
// `markKey` (`marks.ts`), which mint a key rather than answer. All four canonicalize
// for the one reason: the sides are a WASM read and a JS projection, and neither
// promises the other's key order. So nothing crossing this seam compares with
// `JSON.stringify`, and a fifth strategy is one of these four in the wrong place.
