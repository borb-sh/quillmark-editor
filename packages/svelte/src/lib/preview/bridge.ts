// The click bridge: a click on a page slot resolves pixel -> PDF-pt (geometry.ts's
// inverse transform) -> an address, surfaced through `onPick`. Also the
// editor->preview scroll commands (`scrollToField`/`focusPosition`), which place an
// ephemeral marker at the target's % position and measure it, reading the same
// percent geometry through the forward transform, so zoom and resize need no
// hand-rolled pixel offset of their own.
//
// The scroll itself is the scrollport's, written as `container.scrollTop`, not
// `marker.scrollIntoView()`: that walks every scrollable ancestor, so a host
// whose document scrolls (the playground below its split threshold) has the
// whole page dragged to the preview by a keystroke in the editor. The preview
// moves its own scrollport and nothing else, instantly: no `scroll-behavior` on
// the container means no motion for a reduced-motion term to cancel.
