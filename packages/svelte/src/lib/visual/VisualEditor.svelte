<!--
 The editor's door, and the whole of what it adds is the re-key: swapping the
 `doc` prop remounts the editor under it, so a consumer holding one mount across
 two documents gets a surface that names the live handle.

 IT IS A `{#key}`, NOT A RESEED. The state a swap invalidates is not one field:
 composable cards key on session id, the main card is keyed on nothing, and each
 prose leaf mounts once per stable leaf key with `createField` closing over the
 `doc` it mounted against — so after an in-place swap the main card's leaves
 commit to the PREVIOUS handle. Reseeding by hand means threading a generation
 token through every leaf key and resetting the id state, the commit-error map,
 the active address, the leaf registry, the card refs and any pending scroll,
 which is a remount spelled out one field at a time. This spells it as one.

 Teardown order is the one `core/teardown.ts` states: the outgoing mount
 unregisters, cancels its pending ticks, and only then releases, so a continuation
 awaiting a flush across the swap runs against nothing.

 `quill` is NOT part of the key: the schema is re-read on every derive, so a quill
 swap re-projects correctly on its own, and keying on it would throw away a card
 tree that did not need rebuilding. What it cannot do is re-mount the leaves, so a
 quill swapped WITHOUT a doc swap reports `rebind-ignored` rather than passing
 silently.
