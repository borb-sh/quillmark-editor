 * reorder: `Addr` and `DocPath` are both positional, so a host holding
 * `cards.indorsement[2].from` names a different card after one `moveCard`, and
 * silently. The key does not move.
 *
 * Session-scoped by construction. Nothing document-side backs it (the document model
 * carries no card handle): it is minted at mount and dies with the surface, so it
 * does not survive a reload and a host persisting one is persisting a session key.
 *
 * The editor owns structural mutation for the session. The keys track the inserts,
 * moves and removals the editor performs; a host that mutates the card array behind
 * it (its own `doc.insertCard`) desyncs them, and the answer is to re-seed the
 * surface rather than expect the keys to follow. There is nothing document-side to
 * reconcile against, so this is a contract rather than a mechanism.
